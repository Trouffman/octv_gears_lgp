OverClocking-TV Gear Family project.

Goal of this project :
Add support for Avermedia C875 Device on Linux.
Control and use the device with v4l2


Device supported :
Avermedia C875 - Live Gamer Portable

Status :
Project cancelled before a reliable working solution was found. Due to lack of time and ressources.
The C875 device is end-of-life ansd Avermedia do not support it nor provide firmware update anymore.

In 2019/2020 the market is filled with UVC Compliant USB HDMI Capture. It is strongly suggested, to look for these devices rather than trying to make this old one works.

The source is avalable for learning purposes.
